## What is this?

Jan 2019: A WORK IN PROGRESS!

A PHP library for encoding payment data suited to (Lightning Network)[https://lightning.network] payments. It could be used as the source data for
rendering into a QR code. The format adheres to a minimal subset of the (BOLT11 standard)[https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lightning-rfc/blob/master/11-payment-encoding.md].

## Installation

```bash
composer require dcentrica/lightning-bolt11-php
```

## Usage

```php
<?php

use DCentrica\LightningNetwork\Bolt11;

$encoder = (new Bolt11())
	->setCointType(<bitcoin|litecoin|testnet|regtest|litecoin_testnet>)
	->setLightningAddress(<lightning-address>)
	->setFallbackAddress(<bitcoin-address>)
	->setAmount(<amount-in-staoshi>)
	->setPayeeNodeKey(<key>)
	->setPaymentRequest(<request>)
	->setPrivKey(<request>)
	->setPrefix(<prefix>);
```

## Credits

This PHP library is a port of the (bitcoinjs/bolt11)[https://github.com/bitcoinjs/bolt11] JavaScript library, big thanks to the multiple authors.
